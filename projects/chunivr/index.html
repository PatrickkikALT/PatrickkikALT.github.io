        <p class="boxText">ChuniVR is a VR emulator I developed during school for the arcade game Chunithm.
            <br> While I did this as a school project, I only did so because I could then focus
            all of my attention on to it, and I would've done it outside of school anyway. <br>
            <br>
            To understand this project, you will first need to understand Chunithm as a game. <br>
            Chunithm is a japanese arcade rhythm game developed by SEGA. While it's not as popular here in Europe and the USA, it's really popular in most parts of Asia. 
            <br>
            <iframe width="400" height="220" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bgPKOkzX1KY?si=-6FwakbbULwMoOai" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <br>
            Unfortunately, this means it's quite hard to play outside of Asia. There are currently only 5 cabs in my entire country, and only 26 in Europe, and none of them are official.
            <br>
            While you can buy a controller to replicate it, these are expensive, and usually will cost you up to 500 euros, due to expensive shipping costs and import from Asia.
            <br>
            <br>
            With this in mind, I came up with the idea because of similar projects happening for other arcade games, being WACCA and maimai, and their respective projects (<a href="https://github.com/xiaopeng12138/WacVR">WacVR</a> and <a href="https://github.com/xiaopeng12138/MaiDXR">MaiDXR</a>)

        <h2 class="boxText"><a href="https://github.com/PatrickkikALT/ChuniVRIO">The IO</a></h2>
        <p class="boxText">Before even starting the development, I started researching how I would do it, and stumbled upon a project called segatools, which allowed me to easily get my own dlls working inside most SEGA/SEGA-related arcade games.
            <br> And so, I started testing things out. It took me a while to get something that actually works, as this was my first time actually developing an end product in C. <br> I landed on using Shared Memory for sending the input through, since as far as I know, this has the lowest latency out of all IPC communication methods. 
            Using the previously mentioned segatools, I was able to easily send through whatever I received through the shared memory into the callback provided by the program, which gave me input!
            <br> <br>
            How does it work? I simply send through a 34-sized byte array, where byte[2] to byte[34] are the touch cells used in the game, which can simply be set to a specific force input that tells the game if its enough to trigger. The air sensors were a bit trickier to figure out, but ended up being quite simple as well.
            The game expects the air sensors to be one byte, where 6 out of the 8 bits are actually used. Every physical air sensor has a corresponding bit in the byte, air sensor 1 would be bit 1 etc. 
            <br>
            In Unity, I could simply detect which air sensors were broken using a raycast, and then change the corresponding bit in the byte to 1, then send it through.

            <br> <br>
            Now, the worst part of all, the LEDs. These were a pain. I haven't even fully implemented them yet at the time of writing, as these were a pain to get working in the first place, and I don't want to mess it up.
            The way it works right now is by connecting to a pipe that segatools creates for me, but the format of these LEDs is god awful. For the slider, the pipe sends a byte[3][31] array, formatted in a right to left order in a BRG format and it alternates between the actual keys and the dividers in between. This means I had to actually copy the LED colors from the cells above, instead of each having their own. Worst of all, it still doesn't work correctly, I think it's supposed to become a gradient between the previous LED state as well.
        </p>

        <h2 class="boxText">The Unity Project</h2>
        <p class="boxText">Of course, the main part was obviously the actual VR environment. I decided to go for a simple box, with just the cab and a few decorations. Because I kind of suck at 3D art, and graphics design is not my passion (as you might be able to see from this website), I used a Chunithm Cab graciously provided to me by <a href="https://github.com/raymonable">Raymond.</a> <br>
        Now the Unity Setup was not complex at all, all I needed to do was be able to collide with the VR controller and with that send the corresponding input through to the shared memory. The hardest part was making it feel good to play, as the game is kind of scuffed to play without full finger control. <br>
        Which is also the reason why I decided to mess around with hand tracking for this project, however there is simply too much latency for it to be an actual option.</p>
        <p class="boxText">I will still be maintaining this project and trying to improve it as much as I can, so keep an eye on here for updates!</p>
